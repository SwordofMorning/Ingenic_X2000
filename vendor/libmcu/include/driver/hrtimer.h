/*
 * Values to track state of the timer
 *
 * Possible states:
 *
 * 0x00     inactive
 * 0x01     enqueued into rbtree
 * 0x02     callback function running
 *
 *
 * The "callback function running and enqueued" status is only possible on
 * SMP. It happens for example when a posix timer expired and the callback
 * queued a signal. Between dropping the lock which protects the posix timer
 * and reacquiring the base lock of the hrtimer, another CPU can deliver the
 * signal and rearm the timer. We have to preserve the callback running state,
 * as otherwise the timer could be removed before the softirq code finishes the
 * the handling of the timer.
 *
 * The HRTIMER_STATE_ENQUEUED bit is always or'ed to the current state
 * to preserve the HRTIMER_STATE_CALLBACK in the above scenario. This
 * also affects HRTIMER_STATE_MIGRATE where the preservation is not
 * necessary. HRTIMER_STATE_MIGRATE is cleared after the timer is
 * enqueued on the new cpu.
 *
 * All state transitions are protected by cpu_base->lock.
